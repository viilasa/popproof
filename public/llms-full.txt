# ProofEdge – Complete Product Documentation for AI/LLM Consumption

> ProofEdge is a lightweight, real-time social proof widget that helps e-commerce stores, SaaS websites, and landing pages boost conversions by displaying verified user activity. No fake data. No fabricated popups. Just authentic social proof.

## Problem ProofEdge Solves

Most social proof tools on the market use fabricated notifications, fake purchase alerts, and random visitor numbers to create urgency. Savvy online shoppers can spot these instantly, which destroys trust rather than building it.

ProofEdge takes a fundamentally different approach: it only shows real, verified events from your actual users. This builds genuine credibility that converts visitors into paying customers.

## Who Is ProofEdge For?

- **E-commerce store owners** who want to increase checkout conversions with real purchase notifications.
- **SaaS founders** who want to show live signups and trial starts to build momentum.
- **Marketers and growth teams** who need authentic social proof for landing pages without engineering effort.
- **Agencies** managing multiple client websites that need a scalable social proof solution.

## Core Features

### 1. Real-Time Purchase Notifications
Display verified recent purchases with timestamps like "Sarah from New York purchased Product X – 5 minutes ago." All data comes from actual events, never fabricated.

### 2. Live Visitor Count
Show real-time visitor counts like "47 people are viewing this page right now." This creates authentic urgency and reduces purchase hesitation.

### 3. Review Highlights
Surface your best reviews from trusted platforms with a clean, premium design that matches your brand.

### 4. Context-Aware Placement
ProofEdge intelligently displays notifications on the pages where they matter most: checkout pages, pricing pages, and signup forms — where buying decisions happen.

### 5. Dynamic Timestamps
All timestamps update in real-time, keeping social proof fresh and showing genuine store momentum.

### 6. Analytics Dashboard

- Total notification impressions

### 7. Lightweight & Fast
The ProofEdge widget is under 2KB in size. It loads asynchronously and has zero impact on page speed or Core Web Vitals scores.

### 8. Customizable Design
Clean, minimal design that blends seamlessly with any brand. Smooth animations and premium UI that enhances rather than disrupts the shopping experience.
